Each town has [NPCs](npcs.html) roughly equal to the number of houses.
NPCs generate quests.

### Story overarch

Yet to be decided. It is possible to generate overarching stories using
heuristics. For a civil war story, you could choose a capital city
(probably the spawn city) and then have the player deliver messages
and ambush troops in certain locations.

### Rate Limiting

* Each NPC only has one side quest at a time.
* Each town has maximum 10 side quests (number will be changable).

### Potential Problems

* Pregeneration of villages to act as story devices.
	* mg_villages only works so far, and I want to make villages fairly spread apart.
