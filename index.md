# Voxel Legends

Voxel Legends is my fork of the rpgtest subgame for Minetest,
focusing more on singleplayer gameplay and quests. I forked the game as
I want to be able to take my own creative direction. I will be submiting pull
requests to rpgtest and welcome people to back port any changes.

Voxel Legends is set in a medieval world, with elves and monsters to be found.
