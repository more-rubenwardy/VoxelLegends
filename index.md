Voxel Legends is a game based on [rpgtest](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=13761),
both using the Minetest Engine. Voxel Legends focuses on singleplayer gameplay and quests.
I forked the game as I want to be able to take my own creative direction.
I will be submiting pull requests to rpgtest and welcome people to back port
any changes.

* Medieval world
* Elves, monsters and wildlife
* Dungeons
* Many items
