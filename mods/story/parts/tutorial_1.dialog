You : Yes, I heard that this is a city where many adventurers live.
Kai : That is right.
Kai : You dont have any materials to build a house, have you?
You : No, not yet.
Kai : I have some wood for you.
You : Thank you!
Kai : Ok, I think you should get some stones - they lay on the floor.
Kai : Come back when you have some stones.
