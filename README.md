# Voxel Legends

Voxel Legends is my fork of the rpgtest subgame for Minetest, focusing more on
singleplayer gameplay and quests. I forked the game as I want to be able to
take my own creative direction. I will be submiting pull requests to rpgtest
and welcome people to back port any changes.

## RPGTest

RPGtest is an open source sandbox survival mmorpg in minetest.
It is a mixture out of survival, crafting, fighting, exploring and building.
There are different classes (warrior, engineer, farmer...) and many tools/weapons. Every class has own weapons + tools. There are also some rare and legendary items/weapons.
There will be a story and many quests.
